# SurfaceWaterExtent

This repository is to provide additional information for the research entitled:
A framework for gap-filling surface water extent imageries through satellite data fusion and deep learning


The repository contains the following sample codes:
1. Focal loss function
2. Target area visualization (Figure 3).
3. Performance evaluation w/ target pixels identification (Producer's accuracy and rate of underestimation in Figure 4).
4. Masked-Label-Gap-filled image Visualization.
